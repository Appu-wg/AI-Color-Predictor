This project is a single layer neural network consists of
4 inputs __4 neurons__ (first is bias=1 & others is RGB color values)
and one output __1 neuron__
this neural net trains itself on 4 samples of (RGB) red & blue colors
using signum & signum_derivative & dirac_delta functions
to classify your inputed color to blue +1 or red -1
